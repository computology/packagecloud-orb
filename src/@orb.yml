  The packagecloud orb handles common tasks for interacting with repositories on packagecloud.
  To use this orb and interact with the packagecloud CLI, an environment variable *must* be
  created in the CircleCI project settings with the name `PACKAGECLOUD_TOKEN` containing the
  value of a packagecloud API token. The CLI will read the PACKAGECLOUD_TOKEN by default.
